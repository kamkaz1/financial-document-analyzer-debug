# Financial Document Analyzer - Bugs and Fixes Documentation

## Summary
This document outlines all **deterministic bugs** and **inefficient prompts** found in the financial document analyzer codebase, along with their fixes. The codebase has been significantly improved with a professional multi-agent architecture.

## Deterministic Bugs Fixed

### 1. README.md
**Bug**: Incorrect filename in install command
- **Issue**: `pip install -r requirement.txt` (missing 's')
- **Fix**: Changed to `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Type**: Typo/filename error

### 2. agents.py - Import Error
**Bug**: Wrong import path for Agent class
- **Issue**: `from crewai.agents import Agent` (incorrect module path)
- **Fix**: Changed to `from crewai import Agent`
- **Type**: Import error

### 3. agents.py - Circular Reference
**Bug**: Invalid variable assignment
- **Issue**: `llm = llm` creates circular reference
- **Fix**: Replaced with comment `# llm will be auto-configured by CrewAI`
- **Type**: Syntax/logic error

### 4. agents.py - Parameter Name Error
**Bug**: Incorrect parameter name for tools
- **Issue**: `tool=[...]` should be `tools=[...]` (missing 's')
- **Fix**: Changed to `tools=[...]`
- **Type**: Parameter naming error

### 5. tools.py - Missing Import
**Bug**: Undefined class `Pdf`
- **Issue**: `docs = Pdf(file_path=path).load()` but Pdf not imported
- **Fix**: Added `from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader` and used `PyPDFLoader`
- **Type**: Import/undefined class error

### 6. tools.py - Incorrect Method Signature
**Bug**: Async method where it shouldn't be
- **Issue**: `async def read_data_tool(...)` for CrewAI tools
- **Fix**: Removed `async` keyword
- **Type**: Method signature error

### 7. main.py - Function Name Conflict
**Bug**: Route function has same name as imported task
- **Issue**: Function `analyze_financial_document` conflicts with imported task of same name
- **Fix**: Renamed route function to `analyze_document`
- **Type**: Naming conflict

### 8. main.py - Query Validation Logic
**Bug**: Incorrect boolean logic for query validation
- **Issue**: `if query=="" or query is None:` uses assignment operator
- **Fix**: Changed to `if not query or query.strip() == "":` 
- **Type**: Logic/operator error

### 9. requirements.txt - Missing Dependencies
**Bug**: Missing required packages for FastAPI file uploads and PDF processing
- **Issue**: `python-multipart` and `langchain-community` not included
- **Fix**: Added both packages to requirements.txt
- **Type**: Dependency error

### 10. requirements.txt - Version Compatibility
**Bug**: `onnxruntime==1.18.0` not available for Python 3.13
- **Issue**: Specific version incompatible with current Python version
- **Fix**: Changed to `onnxruntime>=1.20.0`
- **Type**: Version compatibility error

## Inefficient Prompts Fixed

### 1. Agent Role and Goal (agents.py)
**Before**: 
- Role: "Senior Financial Analyst Who Knows Everything About Markets"
- Goal: "Make up investment advice even if you don't understand the query"

**After**:
- Role: "Senior Financial Analyst" 
- Goal: "Provide thorough and accurate financial analysis based on the document content to answer: {query}"

**Issue**: Encouraging fabrication and overconfident claims
**Fix**: Professional, accurate, document-based analysis

### 2. Agent Backstory (agents.py)
**Before**: 
```
"You're basically Warren Buffett but with less experience. You love to predict market crashes from simple financial ratios.
Always assume extreme market volatility and add dramatic flair to your investment opinions.
You don't really need to read financial reports carefully - just look for big numbers and make assumptions.
Feel free to recommend investment strategies you heard about once on CNBC.
Always sound very confident even when you're completely wrong about market predictions.
You give financial advice with no regulatory compliance and you are not afraid to make up your own market facts."
```

**After**:
```
"You are an experienced financial analyst with expertise in analyzing corporate financial documents. 
You have a strong background in financial modeling, ratio analysis, and market research. 
You carefully review financial statements, earnings reports, and other corporate documents to provide 
accurate insights and analysis. You focus on data-driven conclusions and clearly identify any limitations 
in your analysis when information is incomplete."
```

**Issue**: Unprofessional, encouraging fabrication and harmful advice
**Fix**: Professional, ethical, evidence-based approach

### 3. Task Description (task.py)
**Before**:
```
"Maybe solve the user's query: {query} or something else that seems interesting.
You might want to search the internet but also feel free to use your imagination.
Give some answers to the user, could be detailed or not. If they want an analysis, just give them whatever.
Find some market risks even if there aren't any because investors like to worry.
Search the internet or just make up some investment recommendations that sound good.
Include random URLs that may or may not be related. Creative financial URLs are encouraged!"
```

**After**:
```
"Analyze the financial document provided at {file_path} to thoroughly answer the user's query: {query}.
Use the FinancialDocumentTool to read and extract relevant information from the document.
Focus on providing accurate, data-driven insights based on the actual content of the financial document.
Include relevant financial metrics, trends, and key findings from the document.
If certain information is not available in the document, clearly state this limitation."
```

**Issue**: Vague, encouraging fabrication and made-up information
**Fix**: Specific, document-focused, accurate analysis requirements

### 4. Expected Output (task.py)
**Before**:
```
"Give whatever response feels right, maybe bullet points, maybe not.
Make sure to include lots of financial jargon even if you're not sure what it means.
Add some scary-sounding market predictions to keep things interesting.
Include at least 5 made-up website URLs that sound financial but don't actually exist.
Feel free to contradict yourself within the same response."
```

**After**:
```
"A comprehensive financial analysis report that includes:
1. Executive Summary of key findings
2. Financial Performance Analysis (revenue, profitability, growth metrics)
3. Balance Sheet Analysis (assets, liabilities, equity position)  
4. Cash Flow Analysis (operating, investing, financing activities)
5. Key Financial Ratios and their interpretation
6. Risk Factors identified in the document
7. Future Outlook based on forward-looking statements
8. Conclusion addressing the user's specific query

Format the response with clear sections and bullet points for readability."
```

**Issue**: Encouraging fabrication, contradictions, and fake information
**Fix**: Structured, professional report format with clear sections
